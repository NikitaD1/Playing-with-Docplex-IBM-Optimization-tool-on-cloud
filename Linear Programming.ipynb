Every LP problem has an associated LP problem known as its _dual_. The dual of this associated problem is the original LP problem (known as the primal problem). If the primal problem is a minimization problem, then the dual problem is a maximization problem and vice versa.\n\n#### A primal-dual pair\n\n<p>\n<ul>\n<img src = \"https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/tutorials/jupyter/training/42.png?raw=true\" >\n</ul> \n\n\n*Primal (P)*      \n-------------------- \n\n $max\\ z=\\sum_{i} c_{i}x_{i}$  \n \n*Dual (D)*\n-------------------------------\n $min\\ w= \\sum_{j}b_{j}y_{j}$ \n \n\n- Each constraint in the primal has an associated dual variable, yi.\n- Any feasible solution to D is an upper bound to P, and any feasible solution to P is a lower bound to D.\n- In LP, the optimal objective values of D and P are equivalent, and occurs where these bounds meet.\n- The dual can help solve difficult primal problems by providing a bound that in the best case equals the optimal solution to the primal problem.\n\n#### Dual prices\n\nIn any solution to the dual, the values of the dual variables are known as the dual prices, also called shadow prices.\n\nFor each constraint in the primal problem, its associated dual price indicates how much the dual objective will change with a unit change in the right hand side of the constraint.\n\nThe dual price of a non-binding constraint is zero. That is, changing the right hand side of the constraint will not affect the objective value.\n\nThe dual price of a binding constraint can help you make decisions regarding the constraint.\n\nFor example, the dual price of a binding resource constraint can be used to determine whether more of the resource should be purchased or not.\n\n#### The dual simplex algorithm\n\nThe simplex algorithm works by finding a feasible solution and moving progressively toward optimality. \n\nThe dual simplex algorithm implicitly uses the dual to try and find an optimal solution to the primal as early as it can, and regardless of whether the solution is feasible or not. \n\nIt then moves from one vertex to another, gradually decreasing the infeasibility while maintaining optimality, until an optimal feasible solution to the primal problem is found. \n\nIn CPLEX, the Dual-simplex Optimizer is the first choice for most LP problems.\n",
